Brewer is a paned coffeescript editor (much like the one found on the coffeescript website) that uses the ace editor for syntax highlighting etc and nodejs to provide saving functionality.

To use download the ace editor from github and place these files in the build folder.  I will clean this up a bit in the coming weeks as I work on packaging it better as a standalone app.
